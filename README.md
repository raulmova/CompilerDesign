# TC 3048 Compiler Design

This is an advanced course in computer science that will integrate the knowledge from data structures, programming languages, software engineering, and general programming so that you are able to design and build a small compiler capable of translating from a high level language into assembly language or to generate an interpreter that executes programs written in a high level language. At the end of this course you will be able to describe and implement the main stages of the compilation process: lexical, syntactic and semantic analysis as well as intermediate generation and interpretation

## Contents

* calculator: A basic calculator that uses Flex & Bison to implement a grammar that manipulates expressions (as covered in class) that also uses attributed grammars to implement a simple interpreter.

* conversion: A Flex & Bison example that uses attributed grammars to convert binary digits read from a text file into their decimal representation.

* grammars: A collection of grammars covered in class that show how to use Bison to generate the parse tables. You can use these examples to study for the next partial exam.

* hash: A set of test and helper functions in C that shows how to use hash tables in Glib. Note that you still have to write some user-defined functions, but the code should help you understand how to build a symbol table. The reason behind the incomplete code is that I plan to use the same code as an assignment for Advanced Programming.
